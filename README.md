# Thongophone-Code
Code for the Embedded System for the Penn State Behrend Interactive Thongophone Project (2020-2021)

The .mid files can be used for testing the code as long as it resides in te same folder as the .py files.  If the
.mid files are NOT in the same folder, filename must be the file path.

NOTE: RPiMain.py is factored into ThongGUI.py
